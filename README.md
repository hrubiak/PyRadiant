Some background
===

The original thermal fitting program, up to version 0.5.5, was based on LabVIEW and called T-View. The PyRadiant versions 0.6 and higher were originaly forked from T-Rax by Clemens Prescher https://github.com/CPrescher/T-Rax, combined with code ported from the legacy LabVIEW version of T-View, and additional features.
